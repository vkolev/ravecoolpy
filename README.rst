RaveCoolPy
==========

It is a simple desktop application written in Python and using the Granite Widgets from elementaryos in order
to play music from `rahechill.com <http://ragechill.com>`_ on your desktop without any browser.

There is no option to download any files and it is not planned to be implemented ever.

This app was created to explore the options of developing python GUI applications for the `elementaryOS <http://elementaryos.org>`_.

Feel free to comment or contribute.
